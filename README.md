<h1 align="center"> Hello, I am "Emory"

## I am a 1-dimensional writer, 2-dimensional graphic designer, & 3-dimensional modeler. I am also currently learning Java, and am starting to code Minecraft mods.

_This_ mostly serves as a way for me to learn & apply various skillsets for my future.
I hope to be a Robotic Engineer, designing & building machines to further automate manufactory. 

_I shall do to humans what cars did to horses._

### My skills, loosely ranked, in beautiful bulletpoint.
- Graphic design
- Writing, Descriptive, Narrative, & Poetic
- Pixel Art
- 3D Modeling (Blockbench, still figuring out Blender)

### My _divisive_ political opinions.
- The world would be better, rid of dolphins.
- A fraction of the United States military budget should go into research on lengthening cephalopod lifespans.
- - (This would do nothing to help the United States, but would aid octopi's ascension into becoming the second intelligent species.)
- The French invented dolphins.
- WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
- Solum nihil est aeternum.
