<h1 align="center"> Hello, I am "Emory"

## I am a 1-dimensional writer, 2-dimensional graphic designer, & 3-dimensional modeler. I am also currently learning Java, and am starting to code Minecraft mods.

I hope to be a Robotic Engineer, designing & building machines to further automate manufactury. 

_I shall do to humans what cars did to horses._
